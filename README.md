# Queue Example Written in Rust
Been learning data structures and algorithms using Rust as a medium, was a bit of a pain to find specific examples online that didn't use C++ or Python.

Figured I'd try and help to solve that problem by adding my own Rust code.

## Issues
I couldn't figure out why the queue wouldn't return an option type when I used the remove() function.

If anyone could explain why that is, please feel free to contact me...
